# Deep Q-Learning Snake Game
I'm horrible at snake, so I made a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Snake through deep Q-learning to compensate for my lackluster skills as a human. To run, download the code, make sure all necessary packages are installed, and run `python snakeClass.py`. It's a pretty quick/unrefined project, and I definitely need to spend some time working on its appearance, but have fun :)
