# DeepQ-Snake
I'm horrible at snake, so I made an AI-driven game of snake using deep Q-learning to compensate for my lackluster skills as a human. To run, simply download the code, change directory to the repo in your terminal, install the necessary packages and run the command '''python snakeClass.py'''. Yeh :)
